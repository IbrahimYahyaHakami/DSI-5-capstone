# Predicting Electricity Power Load

Predicting future electrical power load in Saudi Arabia central operating area.

## Problem Statement

Electrical companies have a challenge to cover the customers power needs, this power load varies between different seasons.

This power needs reaches its peak during summer in Saudi Arabia.


## Interested Parties

Our model is going to predict future power consumption, that will help electrical companies to prepare their power generation plans for short and long term accordingly.


## Success Metric

Our model's performance should be better than the baseline model's performance in order to evaluate the model success. 

## Data-Set

Our data set is the power load for central operating area in Saudi Arabia, we got this data set from Saudi Electricity Company.

the data shows power load recorded for each hour starting from 2012 till 2017.

The data set is considered clean.

## Challenges

Challenge that we will face is making two models, one is a time series model, and the other is a regression model.

The reason for doing regression model is to study the correlation of different features that might effect the electricity consumption.

The main challenge will be collecting the proper features to be used.

## Time Constraint

We think we have enough time to finish the project with the given time.
